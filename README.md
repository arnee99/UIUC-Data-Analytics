# Data Analytics with R – FIN 550 (UIUC, Spring 2025)

This repository contains lecture materials, lab assignments, and datasets from **FIN 550 – Data Analytics**, completed during my graduate studies at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**.  
The course combined theoretical concepts with practical implementation in **R**, focusing on reproducible data analysis, machine learning, and causal inference.
